# Weekly Report of Team n°6 
02/05/2024 to 02/09/2024

### Introduction

The week of February 5th to February 9th posed several challenges for Team n°6, notably in terms of limited project time and issues with task completion and team engagement.

### Accomplishments

On Monday, with only one afternoon dedicated to the project, tasks were assigned to team members without existing assignments:

- Michel RIFF: Completed CMP, JMP, JE, CALL, and RET functions of the Opcode.
- Vivien Bistrel TSANGUE CHOUNGOU & Lucas AUBARD: Continued work on operations functions (ADD, SUB, DIV, MUL) and the interpreter.

### Challenges

- **Lack of Progress and Engagement:**
  - Despite efforts to assign tasks and maintain momentum, certain team members showed a lack of progress and engagement. Raphael DESCAMPS and Loris DE MATTIA SEGALAT's minimal contribution posed challenges for the team's overall productivity.
  
- **Quality Concerns with Documentation:**
  - While Habi CAILLEAU made progress on the Technical Specification, the document's lack of clarity and logical explanation raised concerns about its effectiveness.

### Plans for the next week

1. **Task Review and Accountability:**
   - Conduct individual task review sessions to ensure understanding and accountability. Consider alternative task assignments to address productivity issues.
     
2. **Encouraging Engagement:**
   - Foster a supportive team environment to encourage active participation and engagement. Provide additional support and resources as needed to facilitate progress.
   
3. **Exploring Solutions for Lack of Work:**
   - Evaluate alternative solutions to address the lack of work from certain team members. Consider redistributing tasks or providing additional guidance and support to facilitate contribution.
   
4. **Continued Code Development:**
   - Despite challenges, prioritize ongoing code development efforts. Ensure that progress on the coding front remains steady and aligned with project objectives.

### Conclusion

The week presented notable challenges in terms of progress, engagement, and documentation quality. However, by implementing targeted strategies for task review, documentation revision, and team engagement, we aim to overcome these challenges and foster a more productive and cohesive team environment moving forward. Additionally, exploring alternative solutions for addressing productivity issues and maintaining focus on code development will remain essential for the successful advancement of the project.
