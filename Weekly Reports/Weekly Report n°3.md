Weekly Report of Team n°6
1/22/2024 to 1/26/2024

### Introduction
During the week of January 22nd to January 26th, Team n°6 dedicated the majority of our project time to substantial progress on our virtual processor and interpreter project. Each team member actively contributed to their assigned tasks, collectively advancing our understanding and setting the foundation for the upcoming phases.

### Accomplishments
22nd January
On the initial day, our focus was on refining our understanding of project essentials. We delved deeper into our mandatory requirements and explored approaches to developing a virtual processor. Recognizing the need for our own assembly language, we drew inspiration from the LC-3 architecture, which we deemed more approachable.

Tasks were allocated to team members to kickstart individual contributions:

- **Michel RIFF:** Project Charter document
- **Raphael DESCAMPS:** Functional Specification document
- **Habi CAILLEAU:** Research on the architecture structure inspiration
- **Vivien Bistrel TSANGUE CHOUNGOU:** Coding
- **Lucas AUBARD:** Coding
- **Loris DE MATTIA SEGALAT:** Assistance and initiation of the Test Plan
23rd to 25th January
Throughout these days, each team member diligently worked on their assigned tasks, ensuring progress in line with our project timeline. The collaborative effort was evident as we collectively delved into the intricacies of our respective responsibilities.

### 26th January
Following in-depth discussions within the team, we made a strategic decision to adopt the ARM architecture for our project. The Project Charter was successfully completed, with the only remaining task being the linkage of milestones to other documentation.

### KPI

| Team members | Task | Advance % |
| ------------ | ---- | :-------: |
| RIFF Michel | Documentation | 70% |
| Raphael DESCAMPS | Functional Specification | 60% |
| Habi CAILLEAU | Technical Specification | 5% |
| Bistrel TSANGUE CHOUNGOU | Coding | 10% |
| Lucas AUBARD | Coding | 10% |
| Loris DE MATTIA SEGALAT | Help to Code | - |

### KPI Analysis:

### Challenges
The intricate task of choosing an architecture for the virtual processor required careful consideration and team discussion.
### Plans for the Next Week
As we move into the upcoming week, our primary focus will be on the following:

- Integration of ARM Architecture: Further exploration and understanding of the ARM architecture to seamlessly incorporate it into our project.
- Documentation Completion: Finalize the remaining sections of the Project Charter, including linking milestones to other relevant documentation.
- Start Coding Instructions Command (Opcode): Begin the coding phase with a focus on implementing instructions commands and opcodes based on the insights gained from research and planning.

### Conclusion
In summary, the week was marked by substantial progress, with a clear direction established for our project. The decision to adopt the ARM architecture and the completion of the Project Charter are significant milestones as we move forward with determination and a shared vision.
