# Weekly Report of Team n°6
01/29/2024 to 02/02/2024

### Introduction

The week of January 29th to February 2nd posed challenges for Team n°6 as we navigated productivity issues, particularly in the development of the Technical Specification. Despite individual efforts on various tasks, distractions and challenges hampered our overall progress.

### Accomplishments

#### 29th January
- Loris DE MATTIA SEGALAT initiated the Test Plan.
- Vivien Bistrel TSANGUE CHOUNGOU focused on planning instructions (OpCode).
- Lucas AUBARD planned to work on the code reader and the I/O device.
- Raphael DESCAMPS dedicated time to his Functional Specification.

#### 30th January
- The Functional Specification was completed, albeit not close to the deadline.

#### 01st and 02nd February
- Loris DE MATTIA SEGALAT claimed the Test Plan was finished; however, further verification revealed that content had been copied from a previous project and was unsatisfactory.
- Habi CAILLEAU reported limited progress in the Technical Specification.
- Team productivity was affected, with distractions noted.

### Challenges

1. **Test Plan Validity:**
   - The discovery that the Test Plan had been copied from a previous project raised concerns about its validity and necessitates a comprehensive review and revision.

2. **Technical Specification Progress:**
   - Limited progress in the development of the Technical Specification, which requires immediate attention to align with project timelines.

3. **Productivity and Distractions:**
   - The team faced challenges with distractions, impacting overall productivity. Raphael DESCAMPS and Habi CAILLEAU's engagement in the game "Krunker" led to a significant loss of focused work time.

### Plans for the Next Week

1. **Test Plan Revision:**
   - Loris DE MATTIA SEGALAT will lead the revision of the Test Plan to ensure its originality and appropriateness for the current project.

2. **Technical Specification Development:**
   - Habi CAILLEAU and the team will refocus efforts on advancing the Technical Specification to meet project requirements.

3. **Enhanced Productivity:**
   - The team acknowledges the distractions during the previous week and commits to a more focused approach, minimizing non-project-related activities by assigning task about the code.

### Conclusion

The challenges faced during the week highlight the importance of maintaining focus and adhering to project timelines. Addressing issues with the Test Plan, advancing the Technical Specification, and fostering a more productive environment are key priorities for the upcoming week. Team n°6 is determined to overcome these challenges and ensure a more successful and focused work environment.
