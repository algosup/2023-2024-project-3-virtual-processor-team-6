# Project Post-Mortem: Virtual Processor

## Overview
We were tasked to create a virtual processor and an interpreter that will be use to run an assembly code written in text file. But we had as priority to first impelment simple assembly instructions in C language, create a virtual terminal, and a building system for error detection and then finally create a minimal assembly code to be sure that everything is working correctly.

## Goals and percentage reached

Outline the key metrics and goals established for the project.

Goals:
- Define a minimalistic assembly language optimized for our virtual processor.

- Develop a robust interpreter in C to execute assembly programs seamlessly.
  
- Implement validation mechanisms to ensure program correctness and detect errors.
  
- Integrate system calls for interactive functionalities such as a virtual terminal.
  
- Provide comprehensive debugging capabilities to facilitate development and troubleshooting.

## What Went Well

- All the team members were able to understand the project and the goals of the project.
  
- All the deadlines were respected and the project was delivered on time except for the last part of the project and the test plan.

- There was no friction between the team members.
  
- At the beginning of the project, we were able to communicate with the the team members and the project manager to define the goals of the project and the tasks to be done.
  
- All the documents has been delivred on time.

- We succed to face the challenge of the project and we were able to deliver something that was working.

## Challenges Faced
- The management of the project was a bit rough, it would be necessary to etablished rules at the beginning of the project for every project times so all the team would be more professional and less distracted.

- Not enough communication with team members to know the progress of the coding phase.

- Tasks on the coding part where not ensure proper advancement of the project and time minimisation.

- We didn't analyze the project enough before starting the project.

- We didn't really define precisely the goals of the project and the tasks to be done.

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of communication and the establishment of rules at the beginning of the project.

- The importance of the project manager to ensure the proper advancement of the project and time minimisation.

- The importance of analizing the project before starting the coding phase.

## Recommendations for Improvement
- Communication is key, and we should have regular meetings to discuss the progress of the project and the tasks to be done.

- Analize the project before starting the coding phase.

- Define the goals of the project and the tasks to be done.

- The project manager should ensure the proper advancement of the project and time minimisation.

- Assign task, like the implementation of a particular function to each team member so as not to run out of time.

- More communication with all the team members to know at what level we are. 

## Action Items
- We will build a virtual system for the project so that we will be able to display our assembly code, and the result of the operation it is doing.
  
- Convert the assemlbly written in text file into binary form so as to have a complete interpreter.
  
- Implement unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of the interpreter.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the project was not a complete success but we were able to deliver something that was working. We learned a lot from this project and we will be able to do better in the future. We will take into account all the recommendations for improvement and we will do our best to deliver a better project next time.
