# 1. Introduction (a check)

### Document Objectives & Clarification
The goal of the Technical Specifications is to transform the Functional Requirements, outlining the project's features, scope, and objectives, into clear instructions. These instructions serve as a guide for both the development and quality assurance teams in successfully completing their mission.

We highly recommend a thorough reading of the Functional Specifications before proceeding.

The aim of the Technical Requirements is to dispel as many uncertainties as possible, preventing engineers from making uninformed decisions. While the Functional Requirements address the "What/Why" aspect, the Technical Requirements delve into the "How" of the project.

In this context, we endeavor to cover both functional and non-functional aspects of the project, making informed technological and architectural decisions. We assess, measure associated risks, provide mitigation strategies, and compare potential solutions.

This document also serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders and project owners, offering insight into our methodology. It may be used for future reference in maintenance or for simple documentation purposes.
