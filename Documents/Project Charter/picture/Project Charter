### Project Overview

This project aims to develop and implement a virtual processor, complete with a specialized interpreter for executing assembly code specifically designed for this processor. The entire project will be constructed using the straightforward and portable C language. Emphasizing portability, the approach will strictly adhere to utilizing only C standard libraries, excluding external libraries from the project.

### Project Scope

1. Assembly Language Design:
- Devise a minimal assembly language tailored for the virtual processor.
- The instruction set must encompass essential operations, including but not limited to:
    - Storing immediate values into registers.
    - Copying register values.
    - Reading and storing values between registers and memory.
    - Register content comparison.
    - Unconditional and conditional jumps.
    - Subroutine calls and returns.
    - Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - Logical operations: OR, AND, XOR, and NOT.
Provide a comprehensive description of the assembly language in the functional specification.

2. C Program Development:
- Implement a C program capable of reading a text file containing programs written in the specified assembly language.
- Ensure the C program validates the semantic correctness of the assembly program and detects syntactical errors.
- Describe the intended functionality of the C program in the technical specification.
  
Virtual System Call Implementation:
- Develop a virtual system call for displaying text in a virtual terminal from the assembly code.
- Include functionalities such as displaying register contents and incorporating a built-in debugger to facilitate program observation.
- The technical specification should detail the workings of the virtual system call.

3. Testing and Validation:
- Create small assembly programs serving as conceptual unit tests to verify the correct functioning of the virtual processor and interpreter.
- Conduct thorough testing to validate the overall integrity of the system.
- Document the testing procedures and results in the project documentation.
